# Bird Finder

Bird Finder helps bird watchers find birds in Colorado. Users can search for particular bird species sightings by filling out a form. Once the user submits the form a map will populate with all of the sightings of that particular species in Colorado.

# Installation

**Clone** this repo https://github.com/RyanDBarnett/birdFinder and move into it.

``` git clone https://github.com/RyanDBarnett/birdFinder.git```

``` cd birdFinder```

In the project directory you will need to install dependencies and start the server, please run:

```npm install```

You will need to get api keys for ebird and google maps and place them in src/utils/ebirdKey.js and src/utils/mapKey.js.

Once you have both api keys run:

```npm start```

npm start will run the app in a browser using http://localhost:3000/.
